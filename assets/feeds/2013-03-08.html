    <h2>Error for 'Cannot load player data' has been resolved.</h2>

    <p>This error was caused by Blizzard updating their StarCraft II website to accommodate for changes in the expansion.</p>
    <p>Since SC2Enhanced takes in these information from Blizzard, our services was temporarily down during those times. However as soon as we realized that SC2Enhanced was not working we had fixed the issues within few hours. To reduce the downtime, we encourage everyone to bring these issues to our attension on our <a href="www.facebook.com/sc2enhanced">Facebook page</a> instead of leaving a bad review.</p>
    <p>We are doing our best to maintain and improve this app for the StarCraft II community. We would love it if you can show us your support by liking our Facebook page at <a href="www.facebook.com/sc2enhanced">www.facebook.com/sc2enhanced</a>.</p>
