    <h2>Error for 'Cannot load player data' has been resolved.</h2>

    <p>This error has been caused by Blizzard's update to their StarCraft II website to accommodate for changes in the upcoming expansion.</p>
    <p>Since SC2Enhanced takes in player information from Blizzard, our services was down after Blizzard made those changes. However as soon as we were notified that SC2Enhanced was not working we had fixed the issues within a few hours. To reduce the downtime in the future, we encourage everyone to bring these issues to our attension on our <a href="www.facebook.com/sc2enhanced">Facebook page</a> instead of leaving a bad review.</p>
    <p>We are doing our best to maintain and improve SC2Enhanced for the StarCraft II community. We would love it if you can show us your support by liking our Facebook page at <a href="www.facebook.com/sc2enhanced">www.facebook.com/sc2enhanced</a>.</p>
    <p>Happy Laddering,<br>SC2Enhanced Team</p>
